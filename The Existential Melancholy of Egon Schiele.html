          &emsp;Egon Schiele’s Krumau - Crescent of Houses is a deeply conflicted painting. Through Schiele’s usage of numerous juxtaposed elements, the painting becomes the embodiment of the hauntingly existential, yet incredibly sincere melancholia that develops during a state of deep inner turmoil. The viewer is placed at an angle overlooking a city-like landscape moments after the sunset. Crude lines; stiff, jagged shapes; warm and earthy colors unite in an eerily still image to evoke a sense of anxious, brooding, and wistful contemplation.
	<br>&emsp;At first glance, the most prominent features of the painting seem to be the it’s splotchy warm colors and its sharp angular shapes and lines. These elements develop the painting’s most immediately noticeable juxtaposition, building the foundation of the many juxtapositions throughout the painting. There is a gritty texture throughout the painting that resembles dried tempera paint. Colors are uneven and inconsistent in solidity and intensity. The paint seems to randomly wash in and out in the areas they color making the entire painting look aged. This effect lends itself to the painting being able to evoke a sense of nostalgia, making the viewer feel as though they’ve endured a full life in the painting’s world. There are two distinct patterns of color throughout the painting: blocks colored in various warm hues of orange, yellow, and purple gently illuminate the landscape while earthy reds and browns make the painting's atmosphere feel dim and heavy. Together, the texture and colors of the painting evoke a grounded sense of homeliness, inviting the viewer into what resembles a peaceful, meditative city evening. After a brief examination however, one will notice that the lines and shapes that populate the landscape are in direct opposition to painting’s colors. Lines are crudely drawn like streaks of black ink and the shapes and structures they outline are menacingly sharp and angular. The entire painting mirrors the chaotic patterns seen on a panel of shattered glass, the way each sinister shape in the painting violently cuts into one another. These two contradicting elements juxtapose brilliantly in the painting, forcing the viewer into a state of dissonance as they fight between feelings of comfortable tenderness and bleak anxiety. This inner turmoil inflicted on the viewer exemplifies the painting’s ultimate nature, one that is utterly torn apart by feelings of contemplation, anxiety, and melancholy all at once.
	<br>&emsp;Throughout the painting are tiny planes colored in a mellow yellow and positioned on top of the larger, wall-like blocks of various tints of orange, yellow, and purple that take up most of the painting’s surface. Each of these tiny planes have a grid-like pattern laid over them as if to resemble glowing windows, making the blocks they lay on top of seem like walls of a building. The black strokes of these grids are the thinnest lines found in the painting and exude the same bleakness felt by looking at a wire fence: inhospitable, grim, and anxious. These wired, window-like planes clash against the soft and washed out colors of the wall-like blocks they sit on, skittering across the painting’s surface. They give the viewer yet another juxtaposition to contemplate in painting that is already choked full of conflict, making them gravitate wildly between a bleak anxiety to a welcoming homeliness.
	<br>&emsp;The painting is entirely still, with seemingly no organic matter present. In the bottom left corner of the painting there are multiple series of relatively tiny blocks in various colors: bright whites, muted oranges, and dull blues. These series look similar to line hung clothes and are the most animated parts of the painting, yet even then, they are rendered with sharp angles and very little curves. These series exemplify the essential juxtapositions of Schiele’s painting: forms that are presumably soft but apparently rigid.
	<br>&emsp;The entire painting leverages the viewer at a high angle, as if they had been pensively overlooking the landscape of a city. The image is entirely flat, lacking shadows and depth; forcing the viewer to confront the painting without a clear focal point. Together, the viewer’s perspective and the painting’s lack of focus forms the basis of perhaps one of the most powerful, yet understated examples of juxtaposition in Schiele’s painting. Even when Schiele places the viewer’s eyes above the landscape, the painting’s ability to suffocate the viewer remains at large. Without any semblance of a focal point, every element and detail of the landscape is given the same level of emphasis. The painting feels overcrowded, perhaps even claustrophobic with all the various forms, lines, and details fighting with one another for space. The landscape feels utterly cosmic but more importantly, seemingly on the verge of totally caving-in on the viewer. This effect lends itself to the painting’s immediate existential quality which, while contrasted against the painting’s atmosphere, single handedly generates a chunk of the painting’s power. It allows the painting to strike the perfect balance between something existential and melancholic, drowning its viewers in feelings of existential anxiety, brooding contemplation, and a bittersweet wistfulness all at once.
	<br>&emsp;Egon Schiele’s Krumau - Crescent of Houses is a complete embodiment of a deep inner conflict; a painting filled with contradictions and juxtapositions violently tearing at one another. The viewer is forcibly thrust into a state of confusion, aimlessly jumping between the painting’s sinister shapes, inviting colors, and unrefined lines all the while the city-like landscape threatens to cave-in towards them. Equally, if not more disorienting, are the emotions evoked by the painting: an existential anxiety, brooding contemplation, and bittersweet melancholy. Schiele brings the viewer to the brink of death, when the bitter anxiety and grimness have brewed long enough to show hints of the mournful, the meditative, and the nostalgic; even if for just a moment before an utter collapse.
