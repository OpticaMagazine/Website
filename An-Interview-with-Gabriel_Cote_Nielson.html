        <p class="articlePageTitle">An Interview with Gabrielle Côté-Nielsen</p>
        <p class="articlePageAuthor">Interviewer: Aldon Chen <br> Date</p>
        <p class="articlePageBody">
          Aldon Chen:     What sort of work do you generally make/do? Why does this type of work appeal to you?

<br><br>Gabrielle Côté-Nielsen: I approach a composition in a systematic and structured way in regard to the way that I want to have images within the image interact with each other. I pay close attention to the layers of each image. Building the structure takes the most brain power. Sometimes, I focus on balancing density or weight, pulling a sharper image in front of a softer one. Sometimes I like to focus on how repetition, texture and pattern can evoke a sensation. I like to explore how certain shapes can interact with each other, and how some things tend to blur together. I enjoy this type of work because it feels like I’m weaving fabric in a way, but on a two-dimensional plane. I enjoy that it’s a long process, and that each structure always asks me to push it further the next time around.

<br><br>AC:     What mediums do you usually work with? Why?

<br><br>GCN: I use micron pens and Copic markers to build the images. I work on illustration board, or some type of Bristol vellum. I prefer toothier paper because it feels bouncier to interact with, and it eats a lot of the alcohol marker, which allows for more depth! I like this approach because it’s labor heavy- I typically work at a size of 14”x17” or larger, so I go through lots of inks. I enjoy so many mediums, and I’m excited to discover new layers of my work in mediums that are more expressive since ink, rulers and markers are pretty technical tools.

<br><br>AC:     In exactly three words, describe your artwork.

<br><br>GCN: A chaotic cushion

<br><br><img src="An Interview with Gabrielle Cote-Nielsen/2.jpg" alt="" class="articleImageAlt">

<br><br>AC:     Do you consider yourself an artist? What does art mean to you?

<br><br>GCN: I’d say so, but it feels like an inflated and selfish term in a lot of ways. Growing up I had this assumption in my brain that an artist had to look a certain way, make enough money from producing, or live in this sort of romantic way. But really it isn’t that. I think that identifying as an artist means taking on the responsibility of accepting the unknown, and the commitment to exploring it. In a very human way. It isn’t as high of a compliment as a lot of people seem to chalk it up to be. Art means to me that there is a clear extra layer of this human experience. And again, it’s a sort of inflated term that implies this sort of standard, which I think is what limits a lot of people, myself included. But really, you could be closed-eyed in silence, and if you want to explore the wondrous, vast, and almost dumb experience of being a human, string together a sentence, experience it, open your eyes and you’ve just made art. No one can tell you otherwise.



<br><br>AC:     Throughout your work on Instagram, your drawings seem to have a modularity in them. They are made up of many smaller images containing tiny microcosms, some of which can be seen implemented (slightly differently) into multiple drawings. Can you elaborate on why you implement these tiny worlds into your drawings?

<br><br>GCN: -       Yeah! I like to repeat imagery across drawings most times for the sake of the image themselves. If I felt like in one drawing, this rock thing got the short end of the stick, I try to give it more love in the next one. Or another role to play. The images that repeat are symbols. I draw a lot of these floaty, organic, 3-dimensional holey blob things, that tend to travel across the page. The origin of these was a drawing that had to do with people immigrating to America, under the impression that America provides a kind opportunity, but the direction in which they were traveling was a place filled with conveyor belts and boxes. I call those shapes “the travelers.” They’re hopeful and opportunistic.
<br>-       In terms of combining lots of tiny scenes on one page, I think this feels overwhelming for the viewer at first, but my hope is for the viewer to stop, and pick through it, and rest in whichever place invites them in, whichever place pisses them off, whichever place feels the most comfortable. But they have the opportunity to hop somewhere else if they’d like. I’m not trying to convince the viewer of anything in particular or sell any idea. It’s up to them.

<br><br>AC: Why mushrooms?

<br><br>GCN: There are a million reasons! My emotional connection with mushrooms is that I fell in love with a guy who loved to go mushroom hunting, so he taught me a lot about them. He once told me a lot about how much personality they seem to immediately have once he spots them. Also, and not to be tacky, but Psilocybin provides a specific psychedelic experience that I believe is superior to things like LSD and pot and stuff because of the bodily awareness they bring, the sick feeling a lot of people get before they find release. I use them in my images as a symbolic invitation into my work for people who are interested in exploring their consciousness in a psychedelic way, for them to know I’ve been there too in my past, and I’m working out of that mind in some ways too. They’re friendly and kind.

<br><br>AC:     I noticed that there was a lot of drawings on your Instagram that were black and white, but then later colored. Why do you choose to color them? Additionally, there seems to be a relatively consistent color tonality throughout your drawings. Elements that are evenly split between deep and muted colors. Why do you choose these particular tones?

<br><br> GCN: I don’t always color them because I think some of them wouldn’t benefit from it. I think sometimes color can really mess with them and it makes the image feel a lot less controlled. I choose to color them when I feel that the majority of shapes could benefit from color. I also think that color can provide control sometimes. I choose the tones I do because they’re pretty to me! I don’t often do a lot of planning for this process. I just try to balance as I go and rotate with the same 15-20 markers, sometimes more, sometimes less. I do think about color while I make the composition though- I think about “If I put a set of mushrooms over here, I should put a set of flowers over here, so that the colors will balance when I get there” I like to use natural color for things that are real, but for the things I’ve made up, those get saturated often.

<br><br>AC:     Did COVID-19 have any effects on your art making process in any way? If so, how?

<br><br>GCN: I think the pandemic has benefitted my art in a way, but I won’t give it too much credit. It’s allowed me to feel things I may not have ever felt otherwise, and to feel inspired that we all just keep doing our best. It’s difficult to feel inspired a lot of the time because I’m not able to really freely go to museums or galleries, or work with peers in real life. It’s been weird. I’m not totally sure yet.

<br><br>AC:     Is there anything you’d like to say to other MICA students?

<br><br>GCN: love love love and love
