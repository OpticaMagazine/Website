          <p class="informationBody">Hi there and welcome to The Glitter Room Magazine! We’re a humble internet publication run by a dedicated group of students united under one simple goal: to highlight the wonderful work that students from art schools produce that often has difficulty getting recognized in more established and popular publications. Currently, we’re primarily focusing on giving recognition to the talented students at the Maryland Institute College of Art (MICA) with hopes to eventually include students from colleges all across the country. The Glitter Room currently houses a collection of essays related to visual culture, aesthetics, and art. In the very near future we hope to include interviews and art reviews with the students at MICA. We hope you enjoy the brilliant works currently available on our website and plan to stick around for more. Thanks!</p>
