          Sarah Leiva:     What sort of work do you generally make/do? Why does this type of work appeal to you?

<br><br>Jazz Williams: I’m a mixed media artist who mostly executes mixed media paintings.

<br><br>SL:     What mediums do you usually work with? Why?

<br><br>JW: I like working in multiple mediums, more often than not at the same time, because each medium does its own special thing, and to me, working on many different mediums feels almost comparable to composing a song with many instruments, using oil, acrylic, gel pen, charcoal color pencil, gesso, glaze, cut paper, and oil pastel.

<br><br>SL:     In exactly three words, describe your artwork.

<br><br>JW: I would describe my work as spontaneous, secretive, and very exposed at the same time.

<br><br>SL:     Do you consider yourself an artist? What does art mean to you?

<br><br>JW: I consider myself an artist because art-making branches into so many different playing fields, and although I encompass myself in different hobbies and activities, art always plays into it.

<br><br>SL: Throughout your work on Instagram, your drawings and paintings seem to focus on portraiture and the human figure, mixing in stylized colorful patterns and, occasionally, text. Can you elaborate on why you chose to include these motifs/patterns/words in your work and how they converse with the rest of the portrait?

<br><br>JW: I like when you walk into a room and a painting just calls your attention, whether that be because of the color or the composition or the craftsmanship, it’s nice to portray these decorative figures in decorative environments. The text usually aids as a helping hand almost, if the subject matter isn’t as revealing of the message as I hope it to be, I like hiding little easter eggs of text for context, persuading the viewer to get closer.

<br><br>SL: Why portraiture?

<br><br>JW: I like painting people of color, specifically black people, mostly to immortalize my own life experiences and perspectives in pretty, elegant ways. I feel that my entire art career has been built off a foundation of looking towards white artists who paint themselves in adorning, decorative ways so I figured I’d take some inspiration.

<br><br>SL: What kind of narratives do you wish to convey through your work and how does that impact your decision-making regarding your bold use of color and dynamic compositions?

<br><br> JW: I usually go for womanist narratives about not only the equality of men and femme-identifying people, but also to emphasize the levels of degradation black femme-identifying people go through whilst somehow also being the subject to fetishization. Sometimes I might deviate and overlap topics, including that of black mental health crises that often don’t get enough attention. Once I have the pose, the figure, the outfit, I try to match the background in a color that compliments my narrative or the figure it presents.

<br><br>SL:     Did COVID-19 have any effects on your art making process in any way? If so, how?

<br><br>JW: My family moved around a bit during the pandemic which made me lose my sense of grounding in my artwork. Before COVID I was working my way up to one of my biggest paintings to date, a six foot tall double full figure portrait of two black ladies just enjoying themselves. Today, I’m anxious to work too large because I feel there’s no permanent dwelling for my big work to go at this time and I’m constantly on the move because of school.

<br><br>SL:     Is there anything you’d like to say to other MICA students?

<br><br>JW: I’d like to say to other MICA students, don’t let these assignments stifle your artistic curiosity or limit you. One thing I’ve learned in art school is that you can over-explain anything to make it look good on your part and fit the prompt, don’t stress.
